The project answers key questions such as:

### ** Top Performers**

* Identified the **best scorers** and **best bowlers** in every match
* Highlighted the most consistent players across the tournament

### **Stadium Analysis**

* Found venues best suited for **batting first** and **bowling first**
* Analyzed conditions contributing to higher scores

### Player of the Match Trends

* Identified which roles (batsman, bowler, all-rounder) dominated MoM awards

### ** Match Result Patterns**

* Compared wins by **runs vs wickets**
* Studied how chasing/defending strategies affected outcomes



##  Tools & Technologies

* **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly)** – for data analysis & visualization
* **Google Colab** – for interactive execution
* **Excel** – for initial data formatting
* **MySQL** – for structured querying and validation


##  Key Insights
